 * EliminarCorrespondenciaComponent
 * 
 * This Angular component handles the user interface and logic for deleting correspondence records.
 * It is part of the correspondence management module and provides functionality to allow users 
 * to delete correspondence from the system. This component currently does not contain any logic 
 * for handling deletion itself, but it can be extended to include such functionality in the future.
 * 
 * The component is standalone and does not require an additional module, making it easier 
 * to integrate and test within the Angular application.
